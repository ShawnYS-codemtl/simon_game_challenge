Memory Game Implementation from The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp

The Starting Files included the HTML, CSS stylesheet and the audio files used. The game.js file was implemented by me and contains the logic behind the game mechanics.

The focus of this project was to practice using Javascript and jQuery library.
